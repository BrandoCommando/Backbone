Backbone File Manager
=====================

Backbone is a brand new file manager project for Android 4.0 and up.  We wrote Backbone to walk the line between intuitive use and powerful functionality, so we've got you covered whether you want to modify system file permissions or just move your photos around.

Android has grown - isn't it time your file manager did the same?  Let Backbone simplify your life and make you awesome.
